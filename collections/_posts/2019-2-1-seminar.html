        The Numerical Analysis seminar at Bath has been running
        continuously since 1986 and features a range of invited
        talks from distinguished visitors as well as internal talks
        by staff and students of Mathematical Sciences and other
        Departments at the University of Bath. <br>
        <br>
        <hr> <br>
        The Bath Numerical Analysis Seminar takes place Fridays at <b>12.15</b>

        <h4>How to get to Bath</h4>
        See <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/travel-advice/">here</a>
        for instructions how to get to Bath. Please email Silvia
        (address below) if you intend to come by car and
        require a parking permit for Bath University Campus for the
        day.
        <h4>Tips for new students on giving talks</h4>
        Since the audience of the NA seminar contains both PhD
        students and staff with quite wide interests and
        backgrounds, the following are some guidelines/hints to make
        sure people don't give you evil looks at lunch afterwards. <br>
        <br>
        Before too much time passes in your talk, ideally the
        audience should know the answers to the following 4
        questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What is the problem you're considering? </li>
          <li>Why do you find this interesting? </li>
          <li>What has been done before on this problem/what's the
            background? </li>
          <li>What is your approach/what are you going to talk
            about? </li>
        </ul>
        There are lots of different ways to communicate this
        information. One way, if you're doing a slide show, could be
        for the first 4 slides to cover these 4 questions; although
        in this case you may want to revisit these points later on
        in the talk (e.g. to give more detail). <br>
        <br>
        Remember:
        <ul>
          <li>"vertebrate style" (structure hidden inside - like the
            skeleton of a vertebrate) = good for detective stories,
            bad for maths talks. </li>
          <li>"crustacean style" (structure visible from outside -
            like the skeleton of a crustacean) = bad for detective
            stories, good for maths talks. </li>
        </ul>

        If you have any queries, please email Silvia
        (<font face="Courier"><a href="mailto:S.Gazzola@bath.ac.uk">S.Gazzola@bath.ac.uk</a></font>).
