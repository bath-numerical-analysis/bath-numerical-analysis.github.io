Inverse problems are among the most important computational problems in physics, biology, medicine, engineering, and finance. An example of an inverse problem is the computation of an image from indirect measurements in positron emission tomography; see the image above. While the measured data is not very informative to a medical doctor, the reconstructed image may reveal the location and size of a tumor. Mathematically, inverse problems are not well-posed and they require careful formulation. Here in Bath our research spans various aspects of inverse problems, ranging from mathematical modelling for regularization, over optimization to solve inverse problems, to applications in imaging and machine learning.
