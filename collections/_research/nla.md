A number of applications in science and industry require decompositions of large-scale matrices and tensors. Those include linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems, singular value problems, and structured matrix recovery from incomplete data. Often a small-scale information is sufficient, such as only a few eigenvalues close to a target value, or only a low-rank approximation to the matrix. These problems can be tackled efficiently by iterative methods, such as the inverse iteration, Krylov and alternating gradient descent methods.
