A corner stone of modern data science is machine learning. In Bath, we are working on improving stability and reliability of algorithms and  on applications in both traditional domains like clustering and modern domains such as inverse problems and differential equations. The figure illustrates how a machine-learning model has interpolated between images in a meaningful way.
