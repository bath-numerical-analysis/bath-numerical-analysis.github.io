  title: Deep Image Prior optimization models with automatic regularization
  abstract: 'Deep Image Prior (DIP) is one of the most useful unsupervised deep learning methods for imaging inverse problems. This framework uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as implicit prior to model and represent all the natural images. Combined with classical or novel regularizers, DIP has been shown to be very powerful. However, all the regularized methods, proposed up to now, require a computational expensive estimation of the regularization parameter, to balance the contribute of the regularizer.
In order to overcome this drawback, the original model can be reformulated as an unconstrained or a constrained optimization problem. In particular, the unconstrained model combines DIP with a space-variant Total Variation regularizer with an automatic estimation of the local regularization parameters. Conversely, the constrained formulation is derived from the Morozov’s discrepancy principle, considering an estimate of the noise level in the acquired image. This approach completely avoids the choice of a regularization parameter and it also allows to consider di erent regularizers by making the framework very general and versatile.
Both the arising minimization problems are solved using proximal gradient descent-ascent (PGDA) algorithms and under suitable assumptions it is possible to provide convergence results.'

  title: Numerical methods for fully nonlinear PDE
  abstract: "Joint work with Max Jensen, Endre Süli, Ellya Kawecki and Yohance Osborne 

 Second-order fully nonlinear PDE feature nonlinearities that include the second partial derivatives of the unknown solution. Important examples of fully nonlinear PDE include the Hamilton—Jacobi—Bellman equation, the Monge—Ampere equation and Isaacs’ equation, which arise in a large range of application areas, from optimal control, optimal transport, stochastic games, and many more. The nonlinearity makes the analysis and numerical treatment of these problems particularly challenging, as there is no possibility of a standard weak formulation based on integration by parts of the second-order terms. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the state of art of numerical methods in this area, before focusing on the recent proof of convergence of adaptive finite element methods for the class of elliptic Isaacs equations with Cordes coefficients.

  title: A Hausdorff measure boundary element method for acoustic scattering by fractal screens 
  abstract: 'We introduce and analyse a novel discretization method for acoustic scattering by fractal screens. In contrast to previous studies, in which a conventional boundary element method (BEM) was applied on a “pre-fractal” approximation of the fractal, here we work with BEM basis functions supported on the fractal itself, integrating with respect to Hausdorff measure rather than the conventional surface (Lebesgue) measure. Using approximation results in appropriate Besov spaces on the fractal we prove convergence of our BEM, and obtain convergence rates under natural solution regularity assumptions. We also detail a strategy for the numerical evaluation of the required Hausdorff measure integrals, accompanied by a fully discrete convergence analysis.'
