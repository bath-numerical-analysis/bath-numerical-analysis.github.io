  title: Large multi-response linear regression estimation based on low-rank pre-smoothing
  abstract: Pre-smoothing is a technique aimed at increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in data to improve subsequent estimation and model selection in regression problems. Motivated by the many scientific applications in which multi-response regression problems arise, particularly when the number of responses is large, we propose here to extend pre-smoothing methods to the multiple outcome setting. Specifically, we introduce and study a simple technique for pre-smoothing based on low-rank approximation. We establish theoretical results on the performance of the proposed methodology, which show that in the large-response setting, the proposed technique outperforms ordinary least squares estimation with the mean squared error criterion, whilst being computationally more efficient than alternative approaches such as reduced rank regression. We quantify our estimator's benefit empirically in a number of simulated experiments. We also demonstrate our proposed low-rank pre-smoothing technique on real data arising from the environmental and biological sciences.

  title: 'Percolation and localisation: Sub-leading eigenvalues of the nonbacktracking matrix'
  abstract: 'Network percolation is a well-studied random process that investigates the long-range connectivity properties of a network. The spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix associated to a network is known to contain fundamental information regarding percolation properties. Indeed, the inverse of its leading eigenvalue is often used as an estimate for the percolation threshold. However, for many networks where nonbacktracking centrality is localised on a few nodes, such as networks with a core-periphery structure, this spectral approach badly underestimates the threshold. We study networks that exhibit this localisation effect by looking beyond the leading eigenvalue and searching deeper into the spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix. We identify that, when localisation is present, the threshold often more closely aligns with the inverse of one of the sub-leading real eigenvalues: the largest real eigenvalue with a "delocalised" corresponding eigenvector. We discuss some intuition behind this observation and present experimental results on large scale real-world networks that showcase the usefulness of our approach.'
