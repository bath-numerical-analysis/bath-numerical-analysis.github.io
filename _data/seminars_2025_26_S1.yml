  title: Large multi-response linear regression estimation based on low-rank pre-smoothing
  abstract: Pre-smoothing is a technique aimed at increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in data to improve subsequent estimation and model selection in regression problems. Motivated by the many scientific applications in which multi-response regression problems arise, particularly when the number of responses is large, we propose here to extend pre-smoothing methods to the multiple outcome setting. Specifically, we introduce and study a simple technique for pre-smoothing based on low-rank approximation. We establish theoretical results on the performance of the proposed methodology, which show that in the large-response setting, the proposed technique outperforms ordinary least squares estimation with the mean squared error criterion, whilst being computationally more efficient than alternative approaches such as reduced rank regression. We quantify our estimator's benefit empirically in a number of simulated experiments. We also demonstrate our proposed low-rank pre-smoothing technique on real data arising from the environmental and biological sciences.

  title: 'Percolation and localisation: Sub-leading eigenvalues of the nonbacktracking matrix'
  abstract: 'Network percolation is a well-studied random process that investigates the long-range connectivity properties of a network. The spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix associated to a network is known to contain fundamental information regarding percolation properties. Indeed, the inverse of its leading eigenvalue is often used as an estimate for the percolation threshold. However, for many networks where nonbacktracking centrality is localised on a few nodes, such as networks with a core-periphery structure, this spectral approach badly underestimates the threshold. We study networks that exhibit this localisation effect by looking beyond the leading eigenvalue and searching deeper into the spectrum of the nonbacktracking matrix. We identify that, when localisation is present, the threshold often more closely aligns with the inverse of one of the sub-leading real eigenvalues: the largest real eigenvalue with a "delocalised" corresponding eigenvector. We discuss some intuition behind this observation and present experimental results on large scale real-world networks that showcase the usefulness of our approach.'

  title: Physics Enhanced Deep Surrogates for Solving Partial Differential Equations
  abstract: "I'll present Physics Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) models, a hybrid approach that combines neural networks with traditional PDE solvers to efficiently solve diffusion problems. The method addresses the computational challenge of needing thousands of PDE evaluations for material design optimisation by maintaining physical accuracy whilst achieving significant speedup over conventional numerical methods."

  title: Intraventricular flow reconstruction and graph-based representations
  abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a widely used technique for assessing cardiovascular health and diagnosing various heart conditions. There is good data to suggest that blood flow is sensitive to disease and may provide valuable insights into the efficiency of cardiac pumping and overall circulation. As a result, the blood velocity field within the heart chambers may be a critical parameter in evaluating cardiac function, so accurate measurements could potentially lead to new diagnostic or prognostic metrics for heart failure. However, accurately measuring blood velocity using ultrasound remains challenging due to inherent limitations like noise and the complex nature of blood flow dynamics, in conjunction with flaws in current velocimetry techniques. The left ventricle is particularly important as its primary function is to provide sufficient cardiac output to maintain blood flow to other organ systems in the body. As the left ventricle fills up with blood, the difference between the inlet width and the ventricle width causes a vortex to form, called the left ventricular vortex (LVV). The literature suggests that the vortex formation time and the geometry of the LVV are connected to heart failure and diastolic function. The deviations of expected dynamics of the LVV has been attributed to structural and functional deformities in the heart walls and myocardium (left ventricular muscle). Much of the work in this field have relied on simulations and experiments with models of the left ventricle, while this work has used data collected from a real heart under controlled conditions. Thus far, I have developed an ellipse-fit method to quantify the size and orientation of the LVV in real-time. I aim to extend this work to find unique representations of intraventricular flow fields that can discern different flow conditions. In this talk, I will present an idea that uses Gabriel graphs to form a latent representation of flow fields in the heart.

  title: "From 1/√n to 1/n: Accelerating SDE Simulation with Cubature Formulae (part 1)"
  abstract: Monte Carlo sampling is the standard approach for estimating properties of solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), but its error decays only as 1/√n, requiring huge sample sizes. Lyons and Victoir (2004) proposed replacing independently sampled Brownian driving paths with "cubature formulae", deterministic weighted sets of paths that match Brownian "signature moments" up to some degree D. They prove that cubature formulae exist for arbitrary D, but explicit constructions are difficult and have only reached D=7, too small for practical use. We present an algorithm that efficiently and automatically constructs cubature formulae of arbitrary degree, reproducing D=7 in seconds and reaching D=17 within hours on modest hardware. In simulations across multiple SDEs, our cubature formulae achieve an error roughly of order 1/n, orders of magnitude smaller than Monte Carlo with the same number of paths.
