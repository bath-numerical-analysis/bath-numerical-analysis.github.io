  title: Bespoke preservation of local conservation laws
  abstract: 'The main goal of geometric integration is to reproduce, in a numerical approximation, key geometric properties of a given continuous differential problem. 
  In the numerical treatment of partial differential equations, the benefits of conserving global integral invariants are well-known. 
  Preserving the underlying local conservation laws gives, in general, a stricter constraint. Recently, a new approach has been introduced to develop bespoke finite 
  difference schemes that preserve conservation laws. The schemes obtained in this way typically feature certain free parameters that can be arbitrarily chosen. 
  The first part of the talk illustrates the new approach and its application to the Korteweg-de Vries equation. 
  Numerical tests are presented to compare the obtained schemes and other integrators known in literature. 
  The experiments show that a convenient choice of the parameters yields to very accurate approximations. 
  However, the parameters optimal values are not available a priori and depend heavily on the initial conditions. 
  A new procedure for identifying their optimal values is introduced in the second part of the talk.
  The effectiveness and efficiency of the new strategy is tested. The last part of the talk shows recent advances on the efficient solution of highly oscillatory problems.'

  title: Krylov subspace approximations to the action of unitary matrix exponentials 
  abstract: 'Defect-based a posteriori error estimates for the polynomial Krylov approximation to the action of unitary matrix exponentials (i.e. exponentials of skew-Hermitian matrices) are discussed. Furthermore, a priori convergence results such as the near-best approximation property in the class of polynomial approximations are recalled. The performance of approximations to the action of matrix functions depends on the matrix spectrum and spectral coefficients of the initial vector. Based on properties of Gaussian-quadrature formulae, Krylov subspace techniques provide piecewise estimates on these quantities, and can be further used to classify the underlying problems. For the action of the matrix exponential, this approach is applied to discuss problems for which rational Krylov approximations potentially outperform polynomial Krylov approximations.'

  title: Computing equilibrium distributions with power law interactions
  abstract: 'When particles interact, say by attracting or repulsing, they tend to form nice distributions as the number of particles become large. Examples include both physical (electrons in a potential well, space dust) and biological (flocking birds, bacteria). Na√Øve simulation via differential equations proves insufficient, with computational cost becoming prohibitively expensive in more than one dimensions. Instead, we will introduce techniques based on a measure minimisation reformulation using expansions in weighted orthogonal polynomials to approximate the measures, whereby incorporating the correct singularities of the distributions we can rapidly and accurately compute many such distributions in arbitrary dimensions. This leads to high accuracy confirmation of open conjectures on gap formation (imagine a flock of birds forming a ring, with no density in the middle).  These techniques involve new recurrence relationship of power law kernels applied to weighted orthogonal polynomials.'
