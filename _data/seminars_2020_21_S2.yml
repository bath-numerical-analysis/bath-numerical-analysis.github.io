  title: Automated shape optimization with finite elements
  abstract: Shape optimization studies how to design a domain such that a shape function is minimized. Ubiquitous in industrial applications, shape optimization is often constrained to partial differential equations (PDEs). In such instances, deriving shape derivative formulas by hand and coupling domain updates with PDE-solvers can be challenging, if not discouraging. In this talk, we give a gentle introduction to shape optimization and illustrate how finite element techniques allow automating shape optimization and hence tackling challenging PDE-constrained problems with ease.

  title: Solving Large Systems of Linear Equations or Monster Matrices and How to Care for Them
  abstract: We look at Krylov methods for solving large systems of linear equations. Convergence theory will be given in a hopefully easy way to understand, at least for people who like surfing. Then deflating eigenvalues is mentioned, and deflation is used in a two-grid BiCGStab method. Also, a new stable polynomial preconditioning approach will be given. Next, Krylov methods are developed for rank-one updated systems and maybe there will be time to apply this to singular matrices. Bears will be mentioned along the way including a certain English bear named Winnie. However, no animals will be harmed by this talk except for the feelings of a certain giraffe.

  title: 	Continuum Limit for Lipschitz Learning on Graphs
  abstract: 'In semi-supervised learning one is confronted with a large set of data points, only very few of which are labelled. The task is to find a labelling function which extends these labels to the whole data set. In order to find useful labelling functions, in graph-based semi-supervised learning one represents the data set as weighted graph and poses a smoothness constraint on the labelling function. In this context p-Laplacian learning has become very popular and consists in finding a p-harmonic function which coincides with labels on the labelled set. However, this method is asymptotically ill-posed if p is smaller than the dimension of the data space, and is not feasible for most applications. 
  In this work, I will therefore speak about Lipschitz-learning which aims to find a Lipschitz-extension of the labels and is well-posed in arbitrary dimension. The main result is a discrete-to-continuum limit of Lipschitz-extensions as the data set grows to a continuum. Our theory uses Gamma-convergence and Hausdorff convergence of the data set. As a by-product we obtain a continuum limit for a nonlinear eigenvalue problem related to geodesic distance functions.'
