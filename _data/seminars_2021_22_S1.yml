  title: Dimensional Expressivity Analysis for Parametric Quantum Circuits
  abstract: 'A standard tool in quantum computing are Variational Quantum Simulations (VQS) which form a class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving optimization problems. For example, the objective may be to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian by minimizing the energy. As such, VQS use parametric quantum circuit designs to generate a family of quantum states (e.g., states obeying physical symmetries) and efficiently evaluate a cost function for the given set of variational parameters (e.g., energy of the current quantum state) on a quantum device. The optimization is then performed using a classical feedback loop based on the measurement outcomes of the quantum device. In the case of energy minimization, the optimal parameter set therefore encodes the ground state corresponding to the given Hamiltonian provided that the parametric quantum circuit is able to encode the ground state. Hence, the design of parametric quantum circuits is subject to two competing drivers. On one hand, the set of states, that can be generated by the parametric quantum circuit, has to be large enough to contain the ground state. On the other hand, the circuit should contain as few parametric quantum gates as possible to minimize noise from the quantum device. In other words, when designing a parametric quantum circuit we want to ensure that there are no redundant parameters.

  Thus, in this talk, I will introduce the dimensional expressivity analysis as a means of analyzing a given parametric design in order to remove redundant parameters as well as any unwanted symmetries. Time permitting, we may also discuss best-approximation errors for non-maximally expressive parametric quantum circuits or how to custom design parametric quantum circuits for specific physical applications in which physical states are restricted by a class of symmetries.'

  title: Dynamic inverse problems in spaces of measures with optimal-transport
regularization
  abstract: 'We discuss the solution of dynamic inverse problems in which for each
time point, a time-dependent linear forward operator mapping the space
of measures to a time-dependent Hilbert space has to be
inverted. These problems are regularized with dynamic
optimal-transport energies that base on the continuity equation as
well as convex functionals of Benamou-Brenier-type. Well-posedness of
respective Tikhonov minimization is discussed in detail. Further, for
the purpose of deriving properties of the solutions as well as
numerical algorithms, we present sparsity results for general inverse
problems that are connected with the extremal points of the
Benamou-Brenier energy subject to the continuity equation. For the
latter, it is proven that the extremal points are realized by point
masses moving along curves with Sobolev regularity. This result will
be employed in numerical optimization algorithms of generalized
conditional gradient type. We present instances of this algorithm that
are tailored towards dynamic inverse problems associated with point
tracking. Finally, the application and numerical performance of the
method is demonstrated for sparse dynamic superresolution.

This is joint work with Marcello Carioni, Silvio Fanzon and Francisco Romero.
