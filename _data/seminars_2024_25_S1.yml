  title: Using Firedrake to develop Machine Learning models for atmospheric fluid dynamics
  abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of interest in machine learning based surrogate models for atmospheric fluid dynamics. Successful approaches such as GraphCast [Lam et al, Science, 382(6677), 2023] use an encoder-processor-decoder architecture where the processor describes the propagation of information on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) via message passing. Since the dynamics is approximated on a low-dimensional space, these models are much faster than traditional methods that solve the underlying PDE numerically on a fine mesh. We explore a variation of this architecture where the processor is replaced by the solution of a time-dependent differential equation in a low-dimensional latent space. Compared to GNNs, this allows the application of standard techniques from numerical analysis, thus potentially improving stability and interpretability for example by exactly enforcing conservation laws. To implement this, we use the recent Firedrake/PyTorch interface [Bouziani & Ham, 2023] to train and solve time-dependent PDE surrogate models on the sphere. The encoder in our model combines the interpolation of the initial condition to the latent space on a vertex-only-mesh with a learnable embedding; the decoder has a similar structure based on the adjoint of the interpolation. Our model is trained on numerical solutions of PDE which have been calculated a-priori using Firedrake. The aim of our work is to combine the reliability of Finite Elements with the efficiency of Neural Networks surrogates to produce a competitive model which has the potential to be applied to time-critical applications in weather forecasting.

  title: On the convergence of adaptive approximations for SDEs
  abstract: When using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), numerical solutions are often approximated and propagated in time via discrete step sizes. For a large variety of ODE problems, performance can be improved by making these step sizes "adaptive" – that is, adaptively changed based on the state of system. However, for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), adaptive numerical methods can be difficult to study and even fail to converge due to the rough nature of Brownian motion. In this talk, we will show that convergence does indeed occur, provided the underlying Brownian motion is discretized in an adaptive but "martingale-like" fashion. Whilst this prevents adaptive steps from skipping over time points (which we show can prevent convergence), we believe our convergence theory is the first that is applicable to standard SDE solvers. We will discuss the key ingredients in this analysis – including martingale convergence, rough path theory and the approximation of Brownian motion by polynomials. Based on our theory, we also modify an adaptive "Proportional-Integral" (PI) step size controller for use in the SDE setting. Unlike those used for ODEs, this new PI controller is designed to revisit time points where the Brownian motion was previously sampled. Finally, we conclude with a numerical experiment showing that SDE solvers can achieve an order of magnitude more accuracy with adaptive step sizes than with constant step sizes.

  title: Inner product free Krylov methods for large-scale inverse problems
  abstract: Inverse problems focus on reconstructing hidden objects from indirect, often noisy measurements, and are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. These reconstructions are typically highly sensitive to perturbations such as measurement errors, making regularization essential. In this presentation, I will discuss Krylov subspace methods that avoid inner-product computations and are specifically designed to efficiently address large-scale linear inverse problems.  In particular, I will highlight their regularization capabilities and present computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in different scenarios.

  title: Quantum algorithms for sampling eigenstates with Spectral Sieve
  abstract: I would like to illustrate a method for sampling eigenstates of a class of Hermitian matrices, called k-local Hamiltonians, using a quantum computer. The algorithm will be presented in a framework utilising numerical integral transformations, to implement a spectral projector. A sequence of parameterised spectral projectors will be then shown to drive any state vector to some desired eigenspace. Numerical quantum computational examples and complexity theoretic consequences of the algorithm will be discussed in conclusion.

  title: Fast Kernel Summation via Slicing and Fourier Transforms
  abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. Initially, this problem has complexity O(N<sup>2</sup>), where N is the number of considered data points. In this talk, we propose an approxmation algorithm which reduces this complexity to O(N). Our approach is based on two ideas. First, we prove that under mild assumptions radial kernels can be represented as sliced version of some one-dimensional kernel and derive an analytic formula for the one-dimensional counterpart. Hence, we can reduce the d-dimensional kernel summation to a one-dimensional setting. Second, for solving these one-dimensional problems efficiently, we apply fast Fourier summations on non-equispaced data or a sorting algorithm. We prove bounds for the slicing error, employ quasi-Monte Carlo methods for improved error rates and demonstrate the advantages of our approach by numerical examples. Finally, we present an application in generative modelling.

  title: Accurate and Efficient Numerical Methods for Molecular Dynamics and Data Science Using Adaptive Thermostats
  abstract: I will discuss the design of state-of-the-art numerical methods for sampling probability measures in high dimension where the underlying model is only approximately identified with a gradient system. Extended stochastic dynamical methods, known as adaptive thermostats that automatically correct thermodynamic averages using a negative feedback loop, are discussed which have application to molecular dynamics and Bayesian sampling techniques arising in emerging machine learning applications. I will also discuss the characteristics of different algorithms, including the convergence of averages and the accuracy of numerical discretizations.
