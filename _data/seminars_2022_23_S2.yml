  title: Quantum algorithms for linear regression
  abstract: 'Quantum computers could solve linear algebra problems much faster than classical computers. In this talk, I will talk about some recent quantum algorithms for linear regression with the goal of outputting a vector solution. First, I will introduce a quantum algorithm that accelerates the technique of leverage score sampling (which is a useful technique in randomised numerical linear algebra). Then I will show how to use it to propose efficient quantum algorithms for solving linear regressions. The talk is mainly based on arXiv:2301.06107.''
