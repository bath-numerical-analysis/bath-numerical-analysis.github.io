  title: 'Learning of tensor-valued quantities with the atomic cluster expansion: from (hyper-)active learning of interatomic forcefields to tensor-valued atomic cluster expansion for learning of dynamical systems'
  abstract: 'Complex physical systems are commonly parametrized by tensor-valued coefficients that are functions of the current state of the system. For example, rigorous derivation of the dynamics via the Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism of coarse-grained atomistic systems typically results in a (generalized) Langevin equation with configuration-dependent friction and diffusion coefficients. Learning the dynamics of such systems from data and simulating the inferred model requires efficient parametric representations of such tensor-valued functions. More specifically, such representations should allow for computationally efficient evaluation and data-efficient estimation of their parametrization from data. The framework of the recently proposed Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) [1, 2] has been successfully used for inference of potential energy surfaces and force fields of atomistic systems from data. In this talk, I will first briefly present our recent work on (hyper-)active learning of potential energy surfaces [3] that is based on a Bayesian version of ACE and then discuss extensions of the framework of the Atomic Cluster Expansion to equivariant tensor-valued functions. I will discuss the derivation of the resulting basis expansions for matrix-valued and vector-valued functions and provide an outlook on future applications of the framework. [1] R.

  title: Quantum algorithms for linear regression
  abstract: 'Quantum computers could solve linear algebra problems much faster than classical computers. In this talk, I will talk about some recent quantum algorithms for linear regression with the goal of outputting a vector solution. First, I will introduce a quantum algorithm that accelerates the technique of leverage score sampling (which is a useful technique in randomised numerical linear algebra). Then I will show how to use it to propose efficient quantum algorithms for solving linear regressions. The talk is mainly based on arXiv:2301.06107.''
