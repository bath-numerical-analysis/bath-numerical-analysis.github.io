  title: Quantum algorithms for linear regression
  abstract: Quantum computers could solve linear algebra problems much faster than classical computers. In this talk, I will talk about some recent quantum algorithms for linear regression with the goal of outputting a vector solution. First, I will introduce a quantum algorithm that accelerates the technique of leverage score sampling (which is a useful technique in randomised numerical linear algebra). Then I will show how to use it to propose efficient quantum algorithms for solving linear regressions. The talk is mainly based on arXiv 2301.06107.

  title: Shape optimisation with Lipschitz functions
  abstract: In this talk, we discuss a novel method in PDE constrained shape optimisation.  We begin by introducing the concept of PDE constrained shape optimisation.  While it is known that many shape optimisation problems have a solution, their approximation in a meaningful way is non-trivial.  To find a minimiser, it is typical to use first order methods.  The novel method we propose is to deform the shape with fields which are a direction of steepest descent in the topology of $W^{1,\infty}$.  We present an analysis of this in a discrete setting along with the existence of directions of steepest descent.  Several numerical experiments will be considered which compare a classical Hilbertian approach to this novel approach.
