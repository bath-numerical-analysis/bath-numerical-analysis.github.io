  title: 	'Deep Generative Models in Lattice Field Theories'
  abstract: 'Recent work has taken promising first steps towards an application of deep generative models in lattice field theories. In these approaches, deep generative models are used to generate field configurations. These configurations can then be used to estimate physical observables. In this talk, I will give a (hopefully) pedagogical overview of the subject. In particular, I will outline how these methods can be used to estimate observables which cannot directly be measured by MCMC methods.'

  title: 	'Spectral methods for graph clustering, old and new'
  abstract: 'Graph clustering is one of the fundamental problems of data science and network analysis. Informally, the aim of graph clustering is to partition a network into subsets (clusters) so that nodes belonging to the same cluster are better connected to one another than nodes belonging to different clusters. A popular approach to graph clustering is to use the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to embed the nodes of the network in Euclidean space, and then use a geometric clustering scheme, such as k-means, to partition these embedded nodes. This approach is called Spectral Clustering. In this talk I will survey my work on Spectral Clustering. In particular, I would like to highlight my contributions in bridging the gap between our theoretical and practical understanding of Spectral Clustering. Finally, I will introduce recent work aiming to generalise spectral techniques from undirected to directed networks.'

  title: 	'Fast and stable randomized low-rank matrix approximation'
  abstract: "Randomized SVD has become an extremely successful approach for efficiently computing a low-rank approximation of matrices. In particular the paper by Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp (SIREV 2011) contains extensive analysis, and has made it a very popular method. The typical complexity for a rank-r approximation of mxn matrices is O(mnlog n+(m+n)r^2) for dense matrices. The classical Nystrom method is much faster, but applicable only to positive semidefinite matrices. This work studies a generalization of Nystrom's method applicable to general matrices, and shows that (i) it has near-optimal approximation quality comparable to competing methods, (ii) the computational cost is the near-optimal O(mnlog n+r^3) for dense matrices, with small hidden constants, and (iii) crucially, it can be implemented in a numerically stable fashion despite the presence of an ill-conditioned pseudoinverse. Numerical experiments illustrate that generalized Nystrom can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, especially when r>>1, achieving up to a 10-fold speedup. The method is also well suited to updating and downdating the matrix."
