The Numerical Analysis & Data Science group in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences]({{ site.data.links.dms_url }}) began when Alastair Spence (in 1973) and Ivan Graham (in 1985) came to [Bath]({{site.data.links.uob_url}}). It currently has [expertise]({% link people.md %}) in all areas of numerical analysis and is one of the largest in the UK, and has recently expanded to include a significant interest in data science, including inverse problems and machine learning.


We teach a full range of undergraduate and postgraduate [units]({% link teaching.md %}).
  Our [research]({% link research.md %}) is internationally recognised and we regularly run [workshops and conferences]({% link recent.md %}) including the long-standing [seminar]({% link all_seminars.md %}).

We  welcome applications for [PhD studies]({% link PhD.md %} ), and are always happy to discuss research problems in all areas of scientific computing, data science, and numerical analysis!
