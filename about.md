The Numerical Analysis group in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences]({{ site.data.links.dms_url }}) at the [University of Bath]({{site.data.links.uob_url}}) began in the 1960s. It currently has [expertise]({% link people.md %}) in all areas of numerical analysis and is one of the largest in the UK.

We teach a full range of undergraduate and postgraduate [units]({% link teaching.md %}).
  Our [research]({% link research.md %}) is internationally recognised and we regularly run [workshops and conferences]({% link recent.md %}) including the long-standing [numerical analysis seminar]({% link all_seminars.md %}).

We  welcome applications for [PhD studies]({% link PhD.md %} ), and are always happy to discuss research problems in all areas of scientific computing and numerical analysis!
