          The Numerical Analysis seminar at Bath has been running
          continuously since 1986 and features a range of invited
          talks from distinguished visitors as well as internal talks
          by staff and students of Mathematical Sciences and other
          Departments at the University of Bath. <br>
          <br>
          <hr> <br>
          The Bath Numerical Analysis Seminar takes place Fridays at <b>12.15</b>
          in <b>4W1.7</b> (also known as the Wolfson Lecture
          Theatre). Campus maps can be found <a

          <h4>How to get to Bath</h4>
          See <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/travel-advice/">here</a>
          for instructions how to get to Bath. Please email Andrew
          (address below) if you intend to come by car and
          require a parking permit for Bath University Campus for the
          day.
          <h4>Tips for new students on giving talks</h4>
          Since the audience of the NA seminar contains both PhD
          students and staff with quite wide interests and
          backgrounds, the following are some guidelines/hints to make
          sure people don't give you evil looks at lunch afterwards. <br>
          <br>
          Before too much time passes in your talk, ideally the
          audience should know the answers to the following 4
          questions:
          <ul>
            <li>What is the problem you're considering? </li>
            <li>Why do you find this interesting? </li>
            <li>What has been done before on this problem/what's the
              background? </li>
            <li>What is your approach/what are you going to talk
              about? </li>
          </ul>
          There are lots of different ways to communicate this
          information. One way, if you're doing a slide show, could be
          for the first 4 slides to cover these 4 questions; although
          in this case you may want to revisit these points later on
          in the talk (e.g. to give more detail). <br>
          <br>
          Remember:
          <ul>
            <li>"vertebrate style" (structure hidden inside - like the
              skeleton of a vertebrate) = good for detective stories,
              bad for maths talks. </li>
            <li>"crustacean style" (structure visible from outside -
              like the skeleton of a crustacean) = bad for detective
              stories, good for maths talks. </li>
          </ul>
