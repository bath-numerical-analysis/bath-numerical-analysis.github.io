<h4>Tips for new students on giving talks
</h4>
<p>
Since the audience of the NA seminar contains both PhD students and staff with quite wide interests and backgrounds, the following are some guidelines/hints to make sure people don't give you evil looks at lunch afterwards. </p>
<p>
Before too much time passes in your talk, ideally the audience should know the answers to the following 4 questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem you're considering? </li>
  <li>Why do you find this interesting? </li>
  <li>What has been done before on this problem/what's the background? </li>
  <li>What is your approach/what are you going to talk
     about? </li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of different ways to communicate this information. One way, if you're doing a slide show, could be for the first 4 slides to cover these 4 questions; although in this case you may want to revisit these points later on in the talk (e.g. to give more detail). 
</p>
<p>Remember:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"vertebrate style" (structure hidden inside - like the skeleton of a vertebrate) = good for detective stories, bad for maths talks. </li>
  <li>"crustacean style" (structure visible from outside - like the skeleton of a crustacean) = bad for detective stories, good for maths talks. </li>
</ul>
