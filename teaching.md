We teach across the range of computational mathematics and numerical analysis. Our units, listed to the left, blend rigorous mathematical analysis and practical computational work.

Our advanced units are excellent preparation for [research]({% link PhD.md %}).

Numerical Analysis has strong links with several other areas of mathematics, in particular PDEs and probability, and thus attending courses in these areas would stand any budding numerical analysts in good stead!
