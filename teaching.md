We teach across the range of computational mathematics, machine learning, and numerical analysis. Our units blend rigorous mathematical analysis and practical computational work. 

Our advanced units are excellent preparation for [research]({% link PhD.md %}).

Numerical Analysis & Data Science has strong links with several areas of mathematics --- including analysis, PDEs, probability, and statistics --- and units are available in all these areas at the University of Bath.
